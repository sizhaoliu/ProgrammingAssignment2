## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and their may be some benefit to caching the 
## inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
makeCacheMatrix <- function(m = matrix()) {
  i <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    m <<- y
    i <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() m
  setinverse <- function(inverse) i <<- inverse
  getinverse <- function() i
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse = getinverse)
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above.
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve
## should retrieve the inverse from the cache.
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  i <- x$getinverse()
  if(!is.null(i)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(i)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  i <- solve(data)
  x$setinverse(i)
  i
}
